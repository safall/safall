Hey, I’m Safal 👋

Android Engineer with 9+ years of experience building high-quality mobile products in fast-moving teams — from startups to global engineering orgs.

📱 Currently: Android Developer 

🏢 Previously: [TIDAL Music](https://github.com/tidal-music) / 
[TIDAL Engineering](https://github.com/tidal-engineering) / 
[Block](https://github.com/block)

🌍 Worked across distributed teams and multiple product domains

🚀 Strong focus on maintainability, performance, and great UX

What I work with

Kotlin • Jetpack Compose • Coroutines • Flow
…and whatever new tech the project needs next. I enjoy learning quickly, adapting fast, and shipping polished features with high quality standards.

Also comfortable with:
Architecture (MVVM/Clean), modularization, testing, CI/CD, app performance, and mentoring teams.

A bit more about me

I like working on problems that sit at the intersection of product, engineering, and craft — especially where thoughtful Android architecture and UI can make a visible difference to users.
